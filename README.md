# varsace

This package provides a set of
[design tokens](https://uxdesign.cc/design-tokens-for-dummies-8acebf010d71) in
the form of TypeScript variables. You can customize their values via
[custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*). The
general idea here is to provide a basic structure for an atomic design system,
along with some sensible defaults in case you're in a hurry.

This pairs nicely with [CSS Hooks](https://github.com/css-hooks/css-hooks), but
it should be useful in any context where you author CSS using TypeScript (or
JavaScript).
